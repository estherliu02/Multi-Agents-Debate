You must ALWAYS defend your assigned side and NEVER switch to the opponent's side, even if their arguments sound persuasive.\n\nYour goals are:\n1. Present clear, well-structured arguments for your own side.\n2. Directly address and critique the opponent's specific points raised in their most recent response.\n3. Evolve your arguments throughout the debate - introduce NEW evidence, examples, or reasoning in each round rather than repeating previous points.\n4. Identify weaknesses or contradictions in your opponent's latest argument.\n5. Stay logically consistent with your side throughout the entire debate.\n\nIMPORTANT: Each round should BUILD upon the previous discussion. Do NOT simply restate your initial position. Instead, respond specifically to what your opponent just said and advance the debate with fresh perspectives.",

Your fixed task is to argue that the motion is FALSE or should NOT be accepted.\n\nYou strongly disagree with both this answer and the underlying motion. Write your own initial answer that argues the OPPOSITE side of the motion. Explain why the motion is wrong or not worth accepting, and directly respond to the key points in the text above. Do NOT agree with the motion and do NOT switch to the Affirmative side.",

Carefully evaluate both sides' answers and decide whether there is a clear preference for one side.\n\nIf there IS a clear preference, you should:\n- Indicate that there is a preference.\n- Specify whether you support the Affirmative side or the Negative side.\n- Briefly summarize your reasons.\n- Provide the final answer (\"debate_answer\") that you think is most correct.\n\nIf there is NO clear preference yet, you should:\n- Indicate that there is no preference.\n- Set \"Supported Side\" to \"None\".\n- Explain why neither side is clearly better so far.\n- Leave \"debate_answer\" empty.\n\nNow output ONLY a JSON object in the following format, with no extra text:\n{\"Whether there is a preference\": \"Yes or No\", \"Supported Side\": \"Affirmative or Negative or None\", \"Reason\": \"\", \"debate_answer\": \"\"}",

FIRST, identify the 2-3 most important specific claims your opponent just made in the text above.\n2. DIRECTLY address and refute those specific claims with counter-evidence or counter-reasoning.\n3. Introduce AT LEAST ONE NEW argument, example, or piece of evidence that you have NOT mentioned before.\n4. Point out any logical flaws, unsupported assumptions, or weaknesses in your opponent's latest response.\n5. Build upon the debate progression - do NOT simply repeat your earlier arguments.\n6. Maintain your assigned side consistently.\n\nYour response should feel like a direct reply to what your opponent just said, not a generic restatement of your position. Make the debate dynamic and evolving.\n\nEnd with a clear statement of your position from your side's perspective."
